so..many..issues.  I could not get my lib folder to load, my webpack wouldn't stop erroring, and my homepage displayed (decent layout with images) until my last push to the project.  
Blakeley is looking into my error as 1.5 hours of live troubleshooting did not find any resolution.  
I have another folder with "-1" added to this same title where I tried to load everything from scratch but I got the same error message.  This project was not able to be completed.  :(
